const defiLetter = "Owning and building a platform is what I do and am greatly specialized in. I have also have ample experience and passion for trading. I have spent the last three years fully active in both Cefi and Defi trading and also working across technical aspects like integrating with Defi Protocols, and creating Algorithmic trading systems. Asides from this, I have fully positioned myself for this kind of task. I have a fully remote work setup featuring a 32GB RAM and 4GB GPU on the linux operating system for fast debugging, rapid prototyping and quick delivery. I am confident that I would be one of the best candidates for this role.Thank you, and look forward to hearing from you."
